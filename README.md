### Business Context
The Data team have been receiving multiple ad-hoc requests from colleagues in the Commercial team around access and usage of our product features. Each of these requests have been answered with one-off queries to our Snowflake warehouse. Many of our contracts are due for renewal in the next few months and we therefore expect the volume of these queries to increase significantly.

### Questions
1. How many customers and users currently have access to a particular feature?
2. Which features did an individual customer have access to on a given week?
3. Which customers are using their features the least, and which are using them the most?
4. They have identified a customer who has used a feature that they don’t pay for. How often does this happen and why?
5. Do we experience churn of any features?
